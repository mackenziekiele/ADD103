    <p>
      The latest installment in the DC film catalogue,
      <cite>Superman (2025)</cite> directed by <strong>Janes Gunn</strong>. The
      film stars <strong>David Corenswet</strong> as Clark Kent/Superman,
      alongside <strong>Rachel Brosnahan</strong> as Lois Lane, and
      <strong>Nicholas Hoult</strong> as Lex Luthor. The movie aims to be a
      fresh start to the Superman story. It follows Clark Kent/Superman and the
      consequences he faces after involving himself in an international conflict
      in order to try and save people's lives.

    <h2>Krypto</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>
      One of the best elements of this film is Krypto, Superman's canine
      companion throughout the film. A white mutt that is unruly, ill tempered,
      and playful to the point of harm. While in the beginning of the film he
      comes off as a little bit of a nuisance,
      <small>despite how cute he is</small>, by the end of the film he comes
      through as Clark's fiercest protector.

    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
    <h3>Kindness is the Real Punk Rock</h3>
    <p>
      My favorite quote from the movie comes from a scene at the about half way
      point in the runtime. Clark returns home to rest in his apartment after
      spending all day looking for Krypto, who was stollen by Lex Luthor. His
      girlfriend Lois is already there with a cup of hot chocolate to try to
      comfort him. The two of them to proceed to have a conversion about music
      that is meant empathizes how differently they view the world and people.
      The final lines of there conversation are: <br /><ins>Lois:</ins>
      <q
        >My point is I question everything, and everyone. You trust everyone,
        and think everyone you've ever met is like beautiful.</q
      >
      <br /><ins>Clark:</ins> <q>Maybe that's the real punk rock.</q><br />
      The final line has been paraphrased online as
      <mark><q>kindness is the real punk rock</q></mark
      >, which is the core the message of <cite>Superman (2025)</cite>.<br />
