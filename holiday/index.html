    <h1>My Favorite Things About Christmas</h1>

    <h2 style="color: rgb(192, 134, 64); font-size: larger">Gifts</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favorite parts of the Christmas season is shopping for gifts for
      my friends and family. I love the hunt of trying to find the perfect gift
      for my loved ones. I also enjoy the wrapping process. The best part is
      getting to see my loved one's reaction to the gifts when they open them,
      and getting to see what others got for everyone else.

    <h3 style="font-size: larger">Games</h3>
    <p>
      Every year, after dinner, my family likes to play <i>Wii Sports</i>,
      <i>Wii Sports Resort</i>, and <i>Jackbox</i> games. Bowling is our
      favorite <i>Wii Sports</i> game to play. We typically play at least 5
      rounds of bowling. Our favorite <i>Jackbox</i> games are
      <i>Fibbage</i> and <i>Guesspionage</i>. Personally, my favorite
      <i>Jackbox</i> game is <i>Tee K.O.</i>, but the rest of my family doesn't
      like it because it involves drawing and I'm the only person in my family
      who likes to make art. Some years we even play <i>Wii Fit</i> to weight
      our pets.

    <p>
      Since as long as I can remember my mom has gotten both my brother and I
      advent calendars for us to open up leading up to Christmas. Some years she
      would buy us ones with toys. My brother and I would always hope for a Lego
      advent calendar every year. In more recent years my mom has been filling
      the reusable advent calendar we have with money. It has intermittent green
      and blue doors; I get to open the green doors and my brother opens the red
      doors. My favorite part of out reusable advent calendar is that in the
      middle it hold an old photo from when my brother and I were young with our
      old dogs Chase and Molly.
