            <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <p>My name is Mackenzie, I use she/her pronouns, and I am 24. I have been vegetarian for 10 years because I love animals; my favorite being a fox. I am currently a freshman at McHenry County College.</p>
            <h3>My Career Aspirations</h3>
            <p>I would love to one day work in the animation industry and hopefully as an art director. 2D animation is my favorite art form. Some animated movies and tv shows that inspire me are Flow(2024), The Lion King(1994), and Castlevania(2017-2021).</p>
            <h3>Why I am Taking Fundamental Web Development(ADD-103)</h3>
            <p>I am enrolled at McHenry County College to get the Graphic Design Certificate. I am taking Fundamental Web Development(ADD-103) because it is one of the required classes for the certificate. I admittedly do not have good understanding of coding or web development, and, from the little experience I have with it, do not enjoy it. I am hoping by taking this class that I will come to gain a better understanding of coding.</p>

            <h3>Writing</h3>
            <p>I enjoy writing fiction and poetry. This year I started attending a writers group at a local library to help me be more open with my work. The group is currently making a zine of short stories that we plan to publish around the holiday season this year.</p>
            <h3>Cosplay</h3>
            <p>I got into cosplay in mid 2021. I mainly like to cosplay characters from video games. My favorite cosplay I have done is Lara Croft from Tomb Raider(2013).</p>
            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p>Playing video games is one of my favorite hobbies because it allows me to escape into another world. The systems I have right now are a PlayStation 5, a Nintendo Switch, and my laptop that I occasionally play Minecraft or Stardew Valley on. Currently I have been playing the game Infinity Nikki almost everyday. I find it to be relaxing as two of the core gameplay mechanics are dressing up your character in the clothes you make or find, and collecting materials from around the world for clothes and quests.</p>
